                We have to ask a few questions to confirm your identity. We use an Experian search to generate the
                questions and check your answers against databases they have access to. Can you confirm you're happy
                with us doing that?

            <p class="govuk-body">
                If you agree, I will read the question to you and then read you a choice of answers. Take your time to
                answer them, if you need to look at any documents to help you answer the question that is fine.
            </p>

                I can read you a choice of answers and you can pick your answer, or if you'd prefer you can just tell me
                the answer after the question.
